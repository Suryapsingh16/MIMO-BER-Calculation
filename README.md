# MIMO-BER-Calculation

This project simulates a 4x4 MIMO communication system using Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK) modulation and evaluates the Bit Error Rate (BER) over a range of Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) (from -10 dB to 20 dB) values using Monte Carlo simulations. The system includes Zero-Forcing (ZF) equalization and models a Rayleigh fading channel with additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN).
